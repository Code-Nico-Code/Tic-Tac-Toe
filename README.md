<h2>
Description:
</h2>
<p>
The Tic Tac Toe project is a simple, classic game implemented as an introductory project in programming. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective symbols (commonly 'X' and 'O'). The objective is to be the first player to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
